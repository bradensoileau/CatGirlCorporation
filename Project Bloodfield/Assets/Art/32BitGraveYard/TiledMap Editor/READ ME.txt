While almost all platforms, walls and terrains used the corner set for the auto tile, Fences uses
the edge auto tile set because it best suits tilesets with no sides(e.g. fences). So take this
into account while drawing because it's a bit different to draw. 
Quick tip: the mouse position determines which tile will be shown to you(e.g. if you want to go the
right, lead your cursor to the right)
