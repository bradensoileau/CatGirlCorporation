Patch 1.4---
The abandoned structures got some pixel cleaning and other subtle adjustments. The day theme for it as a request.

I used the ancient ruins as reference but, in case you don't want this version either, shifting HUE from this version 
should be easier and will get you much closer to the day theme you aiming for
